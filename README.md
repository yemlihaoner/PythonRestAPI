This Python Rest API aims to satisfy the requirements listed in a list of requirements defined under a case study PDF.
Basicly the rest api has to: 
* Run an endpoint that operates CRUD operations for authors
* Run an endpoint that operates CRUD operations for categories
* Run an endpoint that operates CRUD operations for blogs

### Installation and Docker Run

Open the terminal(cmd) and write each line to run program on docker

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yemlihaoner/PythonRestAPI.git
   ```
2. Change repository to run endpoints on docker
   ```sh
   cd ./PythonRestAPI
   ```
3. Run docker-compose to activate webapi and database. If error occures related to db generation, Stop docker by CTRL+C and re-run command.
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Warning

In order to upload files to cloud, you will need to set a .env file with required information:
* CLOUD_NAME='cloud_name'
* API_KEY='api_key'
* API_SECRET='api_secret'

In this project, [@cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) is used in order to save files in cloud.
If you dont have an account click the [@link](https://cloudinary.com/) and register for free to access api keys.
